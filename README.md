# elm-playground: a showcase of Elm applications

This is a meta-repository holding some Elm applications
I've been working on. The references are established through
Git's submodules.

### Inspecting available projects

    $ git submodule status

### Checking out submodules

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

You can also checkout only those you are interested in by
giving a path to `init` command.
